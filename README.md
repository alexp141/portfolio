# Overview

A portfolio website created using React.js that uses ReactRouter to switch between pages. The website is styled using CSS with the designs implemented mostly using Flexbox and CSS Grid. The About page displays my name, university, and a brief overview of myself as well as my skills.

The Projects page displays the projects that I have worked with recently ordered in a grid-like fashion.
